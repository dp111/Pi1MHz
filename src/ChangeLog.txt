ChangeLog

v1.03

BeebSCSI changes
 Support all Luns to be open at the same time.
 This actually has simplified code in places.
 The code has be refactored in places to simplify it.
 A number of global variable have become local.
 Unreachable code has been removed.
 Some duplicate code has been removed
 Write buffering has been introduced to increase performance
 Buffers have been increased to 16K to reduced SDCARD access and make use of
 multiblock accesses
 Bugs around testing for errors on dsc file lengths being 22 bytes fixed.
 Starting ADFS with F break now doesn't start any LUNs so SCSIJUKE can be the first command
 Fall back to slow seeking if the LUN us too fragmented instead of just failing over.
